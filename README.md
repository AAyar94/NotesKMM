Notes app; **Kotlin**, **SwiftUI**, **Dagger Hilt**, **Coroutines**, **Lifecycle**, **LiveData**, **ViewModel**, **Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile**, **SQLDelight**, **Cocoapods** based on **MVVM** Architecture.

## Architecture üèõ

**Model - View - ViewModel (MVVM)** is the industry recognized software architecture pattern that overcomes all drawbacks of MVP and MVC design patterns. MVVM suggests separating the data presentation logic(Views or UI) from the core business logic part of the application.

**Shared Module**: The Shared module is at the heart of a KMM project, containing the common Kotlin code that is shared across all platforms (Android, iOS). This module typically includes business logic, data models, and utility functions that can be utilized by both Android and iOS platforms. By sharing code in this module, development efficiency is enhanced, as changes made here propagate seamlessly to both platforms.

**Android Module**: The Android module focuses on the Android-specific implementation of the app. It provides the necessary Android-specific code, UI components, and integration points. While the core logic remains in the Shared module, the Android module allows developers to create the user interface and handle platform-specific concerns for the Android app. This module's primary goal is to create a smooth and native-like experience for Android users.

**iOS Module**: Similarly, the iOS module caters to the iOS-specific aspects of the application. It includes code and UI components that are tailored to iOS devices and their user interface paradigms. This module collaborates closely with the Shared module to integrate the common logic while still accommodating platform-specific requirements. This ensures a cohesive user experience for iOS users.
